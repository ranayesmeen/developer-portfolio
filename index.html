            <h3>New Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I recently started my quest on learning Web Development. Though I am still a beginner with practically no
                skills, I aim to change that very soon with the aid of Programming Hero. Hopefully I will reach my goal
                of becoming a professional web developer very soon. </p>

            <h2>Becoming A Web Developer</h2>
            <p class="spacex">I have adequate knowledge of HTML and CSS to an extent that I can spread my knowledge with
                others and
                teach them. Now, I hope to make many websites and plunge into advanced topics. My journey of becoming a
                professional web developer seems possible now.</p>

                <p>
                    I have advanced knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything required to make a
                    prefessional
                    website functional and efficient. Also, I can work with many frameworks. Furthermore, I have
                    adequate
                    knowledge of servers, security and deployment. If you want a professional website, I will not only
                    reach
                    your requirements, but present something better than your expectations.

                <p>Even though I did not get offered a job, I went for being a remote web developer. I made websites for
                    other companies and they were satisfied. Learning with Programming Hero was definitely a worthwhile
                    experience.</p>
